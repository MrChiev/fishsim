Fish simulator with genetic evolutions.

### 📝 Description 📝

Food appears randomly in the aquarium. Fish must eat to survive. Fish that do not feed die. Fish that feed reproduce. Reproducing fish have a chance to mutate. Fish that mutate have a chance of having a beneficial mutation. Fish that have a beneficial mutation have a chance of surviving longer. Fish that survive longer have a chance of reproducing more often. Fish that spawn more often have a chance of breeding with more fish.
